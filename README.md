# Board Game Club

Welcome to Board Game Club! This Sinatra Web app allows you to create a user with a board game collection. You can also add games to your wishlist and view the games in other users' collections. A user can look up board games in the database table that is built in JavaScript. Sqlite3 is used to persist data in the back end. Bcrypt encrypts a user's password in the back end.
